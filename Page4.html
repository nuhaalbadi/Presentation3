     <h4> Contextual Design </h4>
     <p>This is the first step in Contextual Design in which developers actually go to the users work place and start collecting field data by observing and interviewing users. Most of users’ work is done unconsciously. Therefore, if users were asked to provide detailed information about how they do their work, they would mess out many important details that would be extremely important in designing the software. As such, in Contextual Design, developers conduct one-to-one interview with end users where they first observe how they do their work and ask questions along the way to enhance their understanding of the work being done. It is important that developers share with users their interpretations of the user work and let the user correct these interpretations if they were wrong. This method of gathering design data reduces the complexity of the problem domain since developers get to spend time with users while they are working to better understand their needs. </p>
     
     
   </li>

    <h4> Interpretation Session</h4>
    <p>After the one-to-one session ends, the developers conduct interpretation sessions. The main goal of these interpretations sessions is to share the understanding of the design data a cross the development team. The one-to-one interviews result in a huge amount of data. These data need to be shared with all other team members including managers. The whole team then analyze and manipulate the gathered data to make sure that all aspects of the design is captured in structured data model. These interpretation sessions usually continue until a shared understanding is achieved across the development team. </p>
    <p>Since work practice is intangible, developers need to capture users’ work practice by drawing different work models. There are five main work models in Contextual Design, each captures a different prospective of the work practice. </p>
    <ul  type="square">
    <li>
      <p> The <em>Flow Model</em> captures the different workgroups and their different responsibilities and how work is coordinated and communicated between them. It also illustrates the different types of work (formal vs informal). </p>

    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p> The <em>Cultural Model </em>shows the different constraints that influence the work. These constraints could be internal such as company regulations or external such as regulations enforced by external parties. It also shows how the development team should handle such constrains. </p>

    </li>
    
     <li>
       <p> The <em>Physical Model </em>shows the physical structure of the work environment where work is done and how this physical structure impacts the work being done. It also shows how users organize the physical environment to help them do things easier. </p>

     </li>
     <li>
       <p> The <em>Sequence Model </em>depicts the detailed steps required to accomplish tasks that users do in their work environment. It also shows the goals of each task along with problems that users may encounter while trying to accomplish a certain task. </p>

     </li>
     <li>
       <p> The <em>Artifact Model</em> shows the artifacts the users create and structure to do work. It also shows how these artifacts can be extended to enhance the work experience. </p>

    <h4> Data Consolidation </h4>
    <p>The main goal of this phase is to create a common single view of the customer. Many users have been interviews and each one of them has a different characteristic that shape their use of the system. Therefore, data from different users should be analyzed carefully in order to find a common pattern of the way users work. Affinity diagram (Figure 3.1) is created in this phase which is a hierarchal diagram of the size of wall that brings together the different users scenarios in order to reveal key issues across the whole population and to set the scope of the problem. </p>
    <p>In this phase, consolidated models are created which helps the team identify the key issues of each aspect of the problem at a time. The <em>consolidated flow model </em>depicts the main roles of individuals to identify the roles that need to be supported by the system. The <em>consolidated work model</em> shows the main constraints under which all users are working in order to include such constrains in the the system. The c<em>onsolidated physical model </em>shows the general structure of the physical environment and the common way users interact with such environment. The <em>consolidated sequence model</em> shows the tasks that are needed by all users and how the system will support these tasks. Finally, the <em>consolidated artifact model </em>shows the structure of the common use of artifact across the users and how it is represented. <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/contextual-design">Click here</a> to see examples of consolidated work models. These consolidated work models along with the affinity diagram help create a big picture of the customer for whom developers will design the system. </p>

    <h4> Visioning </h4>
    <p>This is the phase where the development team starts to invent a solution (design) to enhance the work practice of the organization. The development team uses the consolidated work models created in the previous phase to help them invent a story on how the users will work given the new work practice that the development team is envisioning. The new design should address the problems that the customers have with their current work practice by stating how the new design will enhance the customers work practice. The outcome of this phase is a vision that depicts a story of how work will be done given the new solution. Details will not be captured in the vision diagram, instead the vision diagram will provide a general structure of the proposed solution. </p>
