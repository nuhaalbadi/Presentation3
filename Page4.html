     <h4> Contextual Design </h4>
     <p>This is the first step in Contextual Design in which developers actually go to the users work place and start collecting field data by observing and interviewing users. Most of users’ work is done unconsciously. Therefore, if users were asked to provide detailed information about how they do their work, they would mess out many important details that would be extremely important in designing the software. As such, in Contextual Design, developers conduct one-to-one interview with end users where they first observe how they do their work and ask questions along the way to enhance their understanding of the work being done. It is important that developers share with users their interpretations of the user work and let the user correct these interpretations if they were wrong. This method of gathering design data reduces the complexity of the problem domain since developers get to spend time with users while they are working to better understand their needs. </p>

    <h4> Interpretation Session</h4>
    <p>After the one-to-one session ends, the developers conduct interpretation sessions. The main goal of these interpretations sessions is to share the understanding of the design data a cross the development team. The one-to-one interviews result in a huge amount of data. These data need to be shared with all other team members including managers. The whole team then analyze and manipulate the gathered data to make sure that all aspects of the design is captured in structured data model. These interpretation sessions usually continue until a shared understanding is achieved across the development team. </p>

    <h4> Data Consolidation </h4>
    <p>Since work practice is intangible, developers try to capture users’ work practice by drawing different work models. There are five main work models in Contextual Design, each captures a different prospective of the work practice. </p>
