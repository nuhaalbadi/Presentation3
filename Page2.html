   <h3 id="Introduction">› Key Principles</h3>
   <p>There are a number of key principles and motivations that encourage the use of Contextual Design in the design phase. </p>
   <p><ul>
   <li>
     <h4>
       A great system design can not be achieved without having deep understanding of users’ work practice
     </h4>
   </li>

   </p>
   <p>The term "work practice" is defined by <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/contextual-design">Karen Holtzblatt and Hugh Beye</a> as "<em>the complex and detailed set of behaviors, attitudes, goals and intents that characterize a set of users in a particular environment</em>."&nbsp;Therefore, in order to create a system that is accepted and valued by its intended users, it has to be designed to support their work practice. </p>
   
   <p>
   <li>
     <h4>Users can’t convey their work practice articulately to developers</h4>
     <p>Users can’t convey work practice articulately to developers due to two main reasons. First, work practice is something that is experienced rather than said. For example, when you ask a user what do you do when you first set on your desk, he or she may not mention every single detail because some of the things that users do are done unconsciously. However, when you go into their environment and start observing how they do work, and start asking them questions, they will start to be a ware of these important details that would make a great difference in system design.</p>
     <p>The second reason is that user’s domain is usually complex. This complexity may cause a lot of communication problems between users and developers. This complexity will be significantly reduced when developers are in user’s site communicating and talking to users in their environment, which will facilitate understanding user’s domain. </p>
   </li>
   </p>
   
      <p>
   <li>
     <h4>Observations alone would not lead to a good design]</h4>
     <p>That's right. Observations a lone is not enough. There are a lot of important details about users’ practice that can’t be captured by observation a lone. Developers need be involved in conversations/interviews with users. Developers need to develop a partnership relation with users where they observe users work and ask questions all the time in order to better understand user's work practice. These questions should not prepare in advance, but rather questions that basically come up to developers while observing users in their working environment to capture as many details as possible and take these details into consideration while designing the system. </p>
   </li>
   </p>
   
      <p>
   <li>
     <h4>Capturing system design in tangible representations helps convey thoughts between developers and users </h4>
     <p>The best way to make sure that you understand what users are asking for is to develop some kind of a physical representation and ask them if this was what they need. Rapid prototyping is a key activity in Contextual Design. Contextual Design takes into account that observation and communication need to be supplemented with tangible and physical representations such as prototypes, diagrams, sketches, models, etc. to enhance understandability between users and developers. Therefore, Contextual Design requires developers to develop physical representations at each step of the Contextual Design process. </p>
