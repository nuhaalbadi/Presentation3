   <h3 id="Introduction">› Process Overview</h3>
   <p>Contextual Design can be divided into two phases. The first phase is Requirements &amp; Solutions. The second phase is Defining and Validating Concepts as shown in Figure 1 below. </p>

    <h4>
      Requirements and Solutions </h4>
  </li>
    <p>As shown in Figure 1, this phase consists of four main processes: Contextual Inquiry, Interpretation Session, Data Consolidation, and finally Visioning. Each of these processes is discussed in detail in the <a href="Page4.html">following section</a>. The main goal in the requirements and solutions phase is to collect field data on users' work practice and develop a concrete understanding of what users truly need in order to design a system that is completely supportive of users’ work practice.</p>
    <li>
    <h4>Defining and Validating Concepts </h4>
    <p>This phase consists also of four main processes: Storyboarding, User Environment Design, Paper Mock-Up Interviews, and Interaction and Visual Design. These processes are discussed in detail in the <a href="Page4.html">next following section</a>. This phase aims at developing a final system design after going through a serious of prototyping with users in order to capture all details required to better the system design. </p>
