       <h4> Storyboarding</h4>
       <p>In the visioning step, all we had is a big picture of the solution or the system that will enhance the users’ work practice. In the storyboarding, the details of this vison need to be laid out. Therefore, developers will create a separate storyboard for each user’s task that will state exactly how the user will carryout these tasks in the context of the new system in a step-by-step basis. Some describe storyboards as a “freeze-frame sketchers” in the sense that each sketch depicts a single step in the process of accomplishing a task. It is important to note that storyboards need not to describe technical or implementation details, instead, they need to describe the tasks from the user’s perspective. </p>

     <h4> User Environment Design</h4>
     <p>Many refer to this step as drawing the “floor plan” of the system. In this step developers need to show the overall structure of the system, what functions the system support, and how users will interact with the system. The user environment design allows developers to abstract implementation issues and user interface details. It solely shows the overall structure, functions, and flow of the system. The main focus at this step is to make sure that the structure of the system support the work practice of the users described in the storyboards in a coherent way. </p>

     <h4> Paper Mock-Up Interviews</h4>
     <p>Now that the user environment design has been developed, the developers will start working on the user interface with the users. Developers will mockup the user interface using papers and will show these mockups to users. The reason for choosing <a href="http://usabilitygeek.com/paper-prototyping-as-a-usability-testing-technique/">paper mockups </a>is to simplify and speed up the prototyping process in order to get an instant feedback from users. Users will be involved in prototyping the system and their feedback will be used to refine the user interface design. This early user interface testing reduces the change cost; imagine the cost of changing a user interface after implementing its full features and then finding out that this was not exactly what users need. Also, paper prototyping support iterating the user interface design until the optimal design is reached. </p>
